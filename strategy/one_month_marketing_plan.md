# Alavida One-Month Marketing Plan: The Content Flywheel in Action

*High-impact marketing plan to execute the "Content Flywheel" model, turning daily client work into authority-building content and sustainable growth.*

---

## Executive Summary: The Content Flywheel Routine

This plan operationalizes our core strategy. It's a daily routine for turning client work into high-value content that fuels all three levels of our "Trust Stack" brand architecture.

**The Flywheel in Action**:
1.  **Execute & Solve**: Daily client work (`Kattnakken`, `Send.it`, `Liquid Schedule`).
2.  **Systemize & Document**: Keep a work journal of problems, solutions, and insights.
3.  **Sanitize & Publicize**: This plan's daily routine for creating content from the journal.
4.  **Attract & Convert**: The content attracts new leads for Alavida.

**Platform & Funnel Strategy**:
- **Social Media (Twitter/LinkedIn)**: Top-of-funnel discovery (Alexander Girardet brand).
- **Community (Skool)**: Mid-funnel engagement and proof.
- **Newsletter (Substack)**: Mid-funnel education (The Narrative Engine brand).
- **Website/Proposals**: Bottom-of-funnel conversion (Alavida brand).

**Time Investment**: 5-7 hours weekly with clear routines for sustainable execution.

## Strategic Foundation: From Client Work to Content

### Why This Integrated Approach Works
This plan is based on a proven success pattern: authentic, founder-led content rooted in real-world problem-solving generates high-value, inbound clients with minimal "selling." We are not inventing content; we are documenting our work.

### Your Unique Positioning Advantage
Your credibility comes from the intersection of deep technical expertise and a transparent process. By showing your work, you build unparalleled trust that commodity marketing consultants cannot match.
